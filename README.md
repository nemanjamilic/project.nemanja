                        Performance Issues
=============================================================================


Jazz Jackrabbit 2 was designed to utilize the latest hardware technology to 
achieve the best quality and highest possible framerate. The term framerate 
refers to how fast the screen is completely updated with new graphics. 

Jazz 2 is capable of framerates over 70 frames per second (fps), although 
human eyes can barely distinguish framerates above 30 fps. This means Jazz 
Jackrabbit 2 can produce ultra-smooth animation and gameplay under certain 
hardware conditions.

Jazz 2 has different quality settings you can adjust to get the best 
performance from your computer. These options can be changed from the
Options Menu from within the game. Your computer's processor, video card 
and sound card all affect your framerate. We suggest starting out at the 
highest quality settings, then lowering them as needed until you achieve 
the best mix of quality and speed for your computer. 

Here are some tips:

� Make sure you have the latest drivers for your graphics card and sound 
  card. Contact the manufacturers on the World Wide Web or call them to 
  make sure you have the latest drivers.

� Play in Full-screen mode. In windowed mode, it takes more processor 
  power to draw all the graphics in the game as well as the graphics on 
  your Windows desktop.

� Try changing the Resolution to an 8-bit video mode. This will lower 
  the number of colors used in the game, but will definitely help 
  increase performance.

� If your graphics card has good 2D acceleration built in, try turning 
  Hardware Mode on. Note: You will lose realtime lighting and transparency 
  effects in the game, but, unless you have a fast system, Ambient Lighting 
  can lower your framerate dramatically.

� As a last resort, turn off Textured 3D Background. Unless you have a very 
  slow computer, you shouldn't have to turn this option off because the 
  performance gain is fairly small.

=============================================================================

Talking to Other Players
------------------------

During an Internet game, you can 'talk' to all the players in the game, or 
'talk' to your team mates privately.

To start talking to all the players, press the "T" key on your keyboard.
Then, type in what you would like to say. Finish by pressing the ENTER
key. When you press ENTER, your text will be sent to all the other players
in the game. If you press "T" and decide you would rather not say anything,
press the ESC key to go back to the game.

In Capture The Flag, if you would like to talk in private with your team 
mates, press SHIFT+T. This way, you can talk about strategies with your 
team without your opponent listening. If you or one of your team mates types 
private text, their name will be displayed between the "[" and "]" brackets.

                    Known Problems and Solutions
=============================================================================

- Jazz Jackrabbit 2 may have problems if a joystick or gamepad is removed 
  during gameplay. If this happens, you should exit Jazz Jackrabbit 2, plug 
  the joystick or gamepad back in, and restart the game before attempting 
  to continue.

- In some multiplayer modes, it may be possible for the players characters 
  to get "stuck" if more than one character tries to access a spring at the
  same time. If this happens, you will have to start a new game to continue.

- In battle mode, it may be possible for the players' characters to
  get stuck if more than one character tries to access a pole at the
  same time. If this happens, you should still be able to shoot. The game
  will continue when one of the stuck players gets killed.
